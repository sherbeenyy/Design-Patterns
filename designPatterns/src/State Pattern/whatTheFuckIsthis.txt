The State pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to change its behavior based on its internal state. Instead of using complex conditionals (like if-else or switch statements) to manage state-specific behavior, the object delegates the behavior to separate state objects, each representing a different state. This makes the code easier to maintain and extend.

In essence, the State pattern encapsulates varying behavior for the same object, based on its current state, making the object appear to change its class dynamically.



Media Player
A media player has different states for its functionality:

Playing: The media is currently being played, and pressing the pause button will pause it.
Paused: The media is paused, and pressing play will resume it.
Stopped: The media has stopped, and pressing play will start from the beginning. Each state (playing, paused, stopped) has distinct actions when interacting with the player.
